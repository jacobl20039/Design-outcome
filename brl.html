					<h3>Christ the Redeemer - Brazil</h3>
					<br>
					<p>•  Christ the Redeemer is an Art Deco statue of Jesus in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, created by French-Polish sculptor Paul Landowski and built by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, in collaboration with French engineer Albert Caquot. Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida sculpted the face.</p>
					<br>
					<p>•  Standing 30 metres tall, it is one of the most recognized monuments in the world, and is one of the New Seven Wonders of the World.</p>
					<br>
					<p>•  Its outstretched arms represent peace and embrace the city below.
					Material: It’s made of reinforced concrete and soapstone, a durable choice for Rio’s humid climate.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>•  Christ the Redeemer is struck by lightning an average of three to six times per year. Its location on a mountaintop within a rainforest makes it particularly susceptible to strikes.</p>
					<br>
					<p>•  Christ the Redeemer stands as a symbol of Brazilian Christianity and a cultural icon, attracting millions of visitors annually.</p>
