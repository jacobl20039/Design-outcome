					<h3>Machu Picchu - Peru</h3>
					<br>
					<p>•  Machu Picchu is an Incan citadel set high in the Andes Mountains in Peru, above the Urubamba River valley. Situated 2,430 metres (7,970 feet) above sea level, it’s surrounded by lush mountainous terrain.</p>
					<br>
					<p>•  Built in the 15th century and later abandoned, it’s renowned for its sophisticated dry-stone walls that fuse huge blocks without the use of mortar, intriguing buildings that play on astronomical alignments and panoramic views.</p>
					<br>
					<p>•  Machu Picchu’s purpose remains debated, with theories suggesting it was a royal estate or religious retreat.</p>
					<br>
					<p>It was abandoned an estimated 100 years after its construction, probably around the time the Spanish began their conquest of the mighty pre-Columbian civilization in the 1530s.</p>
					<br>
					<p>•  It was brought to international attention by American explorer Hiram Bingham in 1911.</p>
