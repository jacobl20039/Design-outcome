					<h3>Great Wall of China - China</h3>
					<br>
					<p>•  The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications that were built across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe.</p>
					
					<p>•  Stretches over 21,196 km, with sections built over various dynasties for more than 1,500 years.</p>
					
					<p>•  Built as a defence mechanism to protect against invasions, primarily from nomadic tribes, and is equipped with watchtowers and gates, the wall was a complex network of defences.</p>
					
					<p>• It took millions of labourers, soldiers, and prisoners to construct, with many perishing during its construction. The Great Wall remains a symbol of Chinese resilience and remains one of the most visited landmarks in China.</p>
					
					<p>•  It is considered the largest religious structure in the world by Guinness World Records.</p>
