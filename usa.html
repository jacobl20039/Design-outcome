					<p>•  Angkor Wat is a Hindu-Buddhist temple complex in Cambodia. Located on a site measuring 162.6 hectares within the ancient Khmer capital city of Angkor.</p>
					
					<p>•  Built in the early 12th century, Angkor Wat represents Khmer architectural sophistication and religious devotion.</p>
					
					<p>•  Its walls are adorned with highly detailed and intricate carvings depicting stories from Hindu epics like the Ramayana.</p>
					
					<p>•  It was originally built as a Hindu temple dedicated to the god Vishnu, breaking the previous kings' tradition of worshiping Shaiva. It gradually turned into a Buddhist temple towards the end of the 12th century and is still used for worship today.</p>
					
					<p>•  It is considered the largest religious structure in the world by Guinness World Records.</p>
