					<h3>Taj Mahal - India</h3>
					<br>
					<p>•  The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan to house the tomb of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself.</p>
					<br>
					<p>•   The Taj Mahal features detailed inlay work of precious stones on white marble, with symmetry across the entire structure. It took around 22 years and thousands of artisans to complete, finishing in 1653.</p>
					<br>
					<p>•  Elephants played an important role in building the Taj Mahal. As per the reports, nearly 1000 elephants were used to transfer the construction material from one place to another during that time.</p>
			
					<br>
					<p>•  It’s one of the most famous examples of Mughal architecture. The Taj Mahal is regarded as a jewel of Muslim art in India and a universally admired masterpiece.</p>
